Fast.lib is a standard cell library for designing faster gate designs in VLSI.
It contains 477 cells, each of which represents a different logic gate or transistor.
Fast.lib is designed for use in 45nm technology
minimum power supply voltage is 1.32 V.
Each cell in fast.lib has a corresponding gate level netlist and information about its capacitance, area, and other physical characteristics.
Fast.lib is a valuable resource for designing faster gate designs in VLSI and is used by a variety of EDA tools.
The 120Â°C temperature is a typical operating temperature for high-speed VLSI circuits
Delay of 1ns ensures that the cells in the library can operate reliably at this temperature.
Each cell in fast.lib has a corresponding gate level netlist. 
This netlist is used by RTL to map the respective gate to the physical cell in the library. 
The fast.lib file also contains information about the capacitance, area, and other physical characteristics of each cell. 
This information is used by the physical design tools to optimize the layout of the circuit.
Each cell in the fast.lib file has respective pins that are interconnected with wires, ploty, etc. to realize transmission. 
The pins on a cell represent the electrical connections to the cell. The wires and ploty are used to connect the pins of different cells together to form a circuit.
Look-up tables in the fast.lib file are used by the EDA tools to synthesize and place and route the circuit. 
The EDA tools use the information in the look-up tables to generate a physical layout of the circuit that meets the desired timing and power requirements.
The look-up tables allow designers to quickly and easily generate accurate timing reports, which can be used to optimize the design of the circuit.
The capacitance parameters in each cell's entry in the fast.lib file are meticulously delineated. This is important because the capacitance of each cell can have a significant impact on the timing and power of the circuit.
The "fast.lib" file stands as a cornerstone in VLSI design, acting as a repository of crucial data that shapes the behavior, performance, and efficiency of integrated circuits. 
 Liberty files can define libraries of cells with different levels of abstraction, allowing designers to choose the appropriate cell for their design's requirements.
